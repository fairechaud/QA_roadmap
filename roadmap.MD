## What's QA?
Quality Assurance (QA) is an activity to ensure that an organisation provides the best product or service to the customers. QA testing of a software involves the testing of performance, adaptability, and functionality.

SQA extends beyond software quality; it comprises the quality process used for developing, testing, and release of software products. QA relies on the SDLC, which includes the management of *software requirements, design, coding, testing, and release*.

There is a focus on improving the software development process and making it efficient and effective per the quality standards defined for software products. 

## Best practices
+ Create a Robust Testing Environment
+ Select release criteria carefully
+ Apply automated testing to high-risk areas to save money. It helps to fasten the entire process.
+ Allocate Time Appropriately for each process
+ It is important to prioritize bugs fixes based on software usage
+ Form dedicated security and performance testing team
+ Simulate customer accounts similar to a production environment
