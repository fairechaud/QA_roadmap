# Core concepts

## Define 'Quality' (in a Product Development context of course)

Quality is extremely hard to define, and it is simply stated: “Fit for use or purpose.” It is all about *meeting the needs and expectations* of customers with respect to **functionality, design, reliability, durability & price** of a product.
