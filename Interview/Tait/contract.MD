# Received the contract on Dec, 5th:

## Things that stood out, need to inquire about:

1. Salaried status.

I got offered a montly paid position. Ask if there's any potential to negotiate a weekly/fortnightly or if this is totally out of the question.

2. Potential to change the start date in the contract.

Once the salaried thing is cleared out, inquire if this is possible and what sort of carry on would ensued. Word it like this: "it is my understanding that if I begin work on the 15th, on the 20th I would get 1 week of salary in arrears + a third of the monthly pay in advance?".

3. Eligibility to be employed.

I got offered a permanent position, great: am I even eligible to accept the job offer? Need to follow up with INZ.

**Follow up discussion**

According to article 32 of the Core Conditions, it's stated that "IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR NECESSARY WORK PERMITS". My situation is, I currently hold a work visa valid until October 2024, I checked with Immigration NZ about my eligibility to accept a PERMANENT job offer and the outcome was: ################. Based on this condition, what sort of agreement would be in place for me to permanently be employed? Residency visa? Any other type of agreement?

Potential outcomes:

+ They either give me a contract for only the duration of my visa and renegotiate after that.
+ We start a new visa permit altogether (permanent).

4. Clarification on kiwisaver:

It is my understanding that, as a new hire, I don't get to opt in into KiwiSaver schemes until a complete year of tenure. This is also true for medical insurance and superannuation, correct?

With that said, how should I proceed with the KiwiSaver deduction/declaration forms? Opt out?
